# Inventory-Character-Frequency-Analysis
Given a string representing the inventory of a fruit shop, calculate the frequency of each character in the string. The inventory list may contain fruit names, quantities, and additional notes. Ignore spaces and commas, and treat uppercase and lowercase characters as the same for the analysis.

Convert to Lowercase: To treat uppercase and lowercase characters as the same, we convert the inventory string to lowercase.
Character Frequency Calculation: We iterate through each character in the string and use a HashMap to store character frequencies. We skip spaces and commas as they are not needed for analysis.
Output the Results: Finally, we print each character and its frequency.
